dat_short
*********

A URL shortener for DAT/Beaker.

This web application is a proof of concept (nothing more) for a
URL shortener for DAT/Beaker.

Users supply a dat URL and optionally a alternative HTTPS one (HTTP is
not supported). If the browser contacting is beaker then it gets the
dat one. If not it gets the HTTPS one or, if that a HTTPS URL was not
supplied, an informational message

I did this because dat URLs on places like Twitter or Patchwork do
are not clickable. Also it allows for seamless transition between dat
and https.

You can find this at http://s.tiago.org, but beware that this is
just a proof of concept.

Requirements
============

sqlite3

Configuration
=============

- Template configuration

  You can copy all HTML files to config-*.html (e.g. main.html to
  config-main.html) in order to change the templates

- Web server integration

  This was tested with nginx

- Standalone

  This works standalone but it is currently HTTP, not HTTPs.

How to run
==========


`node server.js` (or `npm start`). You will get some help with
`node server.js --help`.
